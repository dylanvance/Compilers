These files are from a semester-long project I completed in collaboration with one classmate for my Compilers course.
It involved created a grammar for the LITTLE toy programming langauge and writing Java files used for parsing the grammar.
This was a very difficult project and sincerely tested mine and my partner's programming skills.
